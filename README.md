# Plant-Disease-Prediction-
In this project, we developed a machine learning-based approach that can identify crops and crop diseases. This approach uses image datasets to predict whether plant leaves are healthy or diseased. By scanning images of plant leaves, the solution can accurately predict the presence of diseases. We have employed various models with different optimizers to identify plant images and predict diseases, and we emphasize the models that demonstrate the highest accuracy based on the results. The dataset we used is called "New Plant Disease" and it consists of 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves. The images are categorized into 38 different classes and 14 different plants, and the dataset is divided into an 80:20 ratio of training and validation data. The source of this dataset is Kaggle.
